## Project Description

The 32-bit floating-point adder follows the IEEE 754 standard for single-precision floating-point arithmetic.

## Circuit Architecture

The floating-point adder is implemented using a modular architecture with the following key components:

### Main Circuit (`main`)
The top-level circuit that coordinates the entire floating-point addition process. It handles:
- Input/output management for two 32-bit floating-point numbers
- Sign extraction and processing
- Exponent and mantissa routing to appropriate sub-circuits
- Final result assembly
- Overflow and underflow flag generation

### Core Processing Modules

#### 1. FirstPart
Handles the initial processing of floating-point inputs:
- Extracts sign bits, exponents, and mantissas from input operands
- Performs exponent comparison and difference calculation
- Determines which operand has the larger exponent
- Prepares operands for alignment and addition/subtraction

#### 2. firstShift
Implements the pre-addition shifting operation:
- Aligns mantissas by shifting the smaller operand
- Handles the shift amount based on exponent difference
- Preserves precision during alignment

#### 3. AfterShift
Performs post-addition/subtraction operations:
- Handles the actual addition or subtraction of aligned mantissas
- Implements normalization shifting
- Adjusts exponent based on normalization requirements

#### 4. Rounding
Implements IEEE 754 rounding modes:
- Round-to-nearest (ties to even)
- Handles rounding of the mantissa
- Adjusts exponent if rounding causes overflow
